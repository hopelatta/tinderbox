# NOTES — Tinderbox Fork

## Why I forked this

This repository is a fork of **Tinderbox**, an open-source seed project for building
a Tinder-like dating interface. I am studying this code to understand how core
interaction mechanics are implemented (swipes, profiles, matching UI) and how those
mechanics shape user behavior and system incentives.

My goal is not to republish this as a complete product, but to *ground abstract
trust & safety concepts in concrete code patterns* that show how social systems
mediate attention and interaction.

## What this codebase contains

- Basic matching and swipe interface implementation
- Profile rendering and navigation
- Simple server-client interaction for likes, skips, and connections
- UI elements that reflect typical dating app affordances

These components reveal how *user action loops* are built and how they shape
exposure, attention allocation, and early user decisions.

## What I’m focusing on

From a platform integrity and trust & safety lens, I am paying attention to:

### Interaction pacing
- Swipe velocity (how fast a user can browse profiles)
- Lack of friction between actions
- How limits might reduce “spray and pray” behavior

### Feedback loops
- How likes/dislikes update user perception of value
- How immediate feedback reinforces engagement

### Safety surface areas
- Where private messaging would be inserted
- What risks emerge when users can contact instantly
- How abuse patterns could be throttled or signaled earlier

### UI and behavior assumptions
- What counts as normal vs anomalous pacing
- How users perceive rate limits or cooldowns
- What default interactions assume about user intent

## How this connects to my broader work

I am exploring how backend systems and UI affordances interact to shape:
- attention asymmetry
- ghosting as structural outcome
- messaging safety
- risk signals that do not rely on content

This fork helps bridge *systemic framing* with *engineering mechanics*.
